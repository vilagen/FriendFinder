  "description": "Thank you for visiting the Friend's Finder page. The goal of this excercise is to create a small, yet full \r stack website from backend to frontend. The Friend's Finder page is like a dating site, except it is just \r finding a friend that is most compatible. At this time, the page isn't fully running as I am still working\r on the logic between the front and back end. But when completed, the site will tally up scores that the user\r inputs, and then will find which person has the lowest score compared to what the user put in. The person with the lowest score means that they have the least amount of difference between them and the user.",
